My name is Shao Voon Wong (黄绍文). I am a C++ developer from Singapore! I prefer to write applications based on 3rd party libraries than rolling out my own library. My interest lies primarily in computer graphics, software optimization, concurrency and security.

Over the years, I have contributed [some C++ and C# articles to Codeproject](https://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/MemberArticles.aspx?amid=88591). Here is my [GitHub.io](https://shaovoon.github.io/). Hope you have fun reading them!

Recently, I released my C++/DirectX photo slideshow application, Mandy Frenzy. You can click on the image below to view its video on Youtube or you can visit its [home page](http://mandyfrenzy.com/) to download or [download direct (note : slow)](http://mandyfrenzy.com/FileDownload.ashx?filename=MandyFrenzy.zip).
